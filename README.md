# Silly-Tavern-Progress-System
Silly Tavern Extension that allows the stored variables to evolve with the story. Dynamic JavaScript support. Includes support for User Interface windows and modifiers. 

Work in progress.. 

Plans:

Currently testing approaches and possibilities for the powerful Novel Mode feature.

Once Novel Mode is finished, official documentation will be released and patches for official alpha-release

UPDATE:

Silly Tavern iterface felt too limiting for comfortable implementation of the Novel Mode, also my changes would be too drastic to the entire Silly Tavern project. Therefore I began writing my own standalone project. Will include link to it once it becomes a working prototype.
